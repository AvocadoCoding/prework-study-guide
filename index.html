        <ul>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In the head element information like the character set and viewport can be specified.</li>
          <li>h1,h2,h3 etc. are heading types.</li>
          <li>Commands like break, paragraph, line, list and section can be used to order page content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied to spcific HTML tags, using a style attribute with CSS rule for a particular element.</li>
          <li>An entire stylesheet with rules for the webpage can also be directly embedded using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet that is lined in the head element is generally preferred - seperation of concerns.</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule has selector defining where the rule will apply, and a declaration which the property to apply and it's value.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attribute allow us to identify different elements, to apply different rules to elements with the same name.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Do itmes of work on feature branch and then merge with man branch.</li>

          <li>Javascript files give a webpage functionality.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
          <li>Use Chrome Dev Tools to debug code and view console.log information. To access 'right click' and then select 'inspect'.</li>
          <li>JS is read from top to bottom and the order counts.</li>
